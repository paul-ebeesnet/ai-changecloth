  - QR code for sharing
  - Link to access the image directly

### 4. Maintained Core Functionality

- ✅ "下載圖片" button is no longer displayed
- ✅ "再玩一次" button is no longer displayed

- ✅ Error handling for upload failures is preserved

## Files Modified
1. **App.tsx**: 
   - Removed text elements from FINAL_RESULT state
   - Removed download and play again buttons
   - Simplified the result display layout

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Open the application
2. Complete the photo process to reach the final result page
3. Confirm that:
   - "縮圖已生成並上傳" text is not displayed
   - "圖片存儲於: https://ebeesnet.com/project/wynn-mif/img/" text is not displayed
   - "下載圖片" button is not displayed
   - "再玩一次" button is not displayed
   - QR code is still displayed
   - Direct link to image is still displayed
   - Thumbnail with "縮圖預覽" overlay is still displayed

## Future Considerations
If these elements need to be restored in the future:
1. The functionality is still in the code, just not displayed
2. The button event handlers (handleDownload, resetState) are still available
3. The text content can be easily re-added if needed
