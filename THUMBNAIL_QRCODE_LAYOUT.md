## Files Modified

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Open the application

2. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Clear section titles help users understand the content
   - Consistent styling and spacing
   - Proper alignment of elements

3. **User Experience**:
   - Easy scanning of QR code next to the thumbnail
   - Clear instructions for sharing
   - Direct link as alternative sharing method
