# Vercel Deployment Summary

## Problem
The previous approach tried to use a Node.js backend server, which doesn't work on Vercel because:
- Vercel is a serverless platform
- It doesn't support long-running backend services
- Direct FTP connections from frontend are not possible

## Solution
Use the PHP API approach that works correctly with Vercel:

### 1. PHP API as Primary Method
- In production (Vercel), the application uses `uploadViaPHP` function
- PHP API handles all file operations on the server side
- No backend service deployment needed

### 2. Correct Upload Flow for Vercel
```
Frontend (Vercel) 
    ↓ (HTTPS request)
PHP API (ebeesnet.com)
    ↓ (FTP operations)
FTP Server (ebeesnet.com)
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Leave `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` unset for Vercel deployments
- PHP API is used automatically in production mode

### 4. Fallbacks
- Cloudinary as alternative if configured
- QR code generation if all upload methods fail
