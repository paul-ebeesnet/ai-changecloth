# Upload Issue Fix Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the upload issue in the AI Changecloth application.

## Problem Identified

The application was failing to upload images with the error message "圖片上傳服務暫時無法使用" (Image upload service temporarily unavailable). After investigation, we found several issues:

1. **Backend Server Not Running**: The backend server was not running locally, but the frontend was trying to connect to it.
2. **Incorrect Backend URL**: The frontend was trying to connect to `http://localhost:3001` but the backend server was running on `http://localhost:3002`.
3. **Proxy Configuration**: The Vite proxy was configured to proxy `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3001` instead of `http://localhost:3002`.
4. **Environment Variables**: The `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` environment variable was not set in the `.env.local` file.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Started Backend Server
- Started the backend server on port 3002:
  ```bash
  cd backend && PORT=3002 node server.js
  ```

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration
- Updated [vite.config.ts](file:///Users/paulchang/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PDF/Ebees/Project/Wynn%20x%20MIF/ai-changecloth/vite.config.ts) to proxy `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3002` instead of `http://localhost:3001`.

### 3. Updated FTP Upload Service
- Modified [services/ftpUploadService.ts](file:///Users/paulchang/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PDF/Ebees/Project/Wynn%20x%20MIF/ai-changecloth/services/ftpUploadService.ts) to use the proxy endpoint (`/api`) in development mode instead of direct connection to `http://localhost:3001`.

### 4. Updated Environment Variables
- Added `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3002` to [.env.local](file:///Users/paulchang/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PDF/Ebees/Project/Wynn%20x%20MIF/ai-changecloth/.env.local) to ensure proper configuration in production deployments.

## How the Upload Process Works Now

1. **Development Mode**:
   - Frontend makes requests to `/api/upload`
   - Vite proxies these requests to `http://localhost:3002/upload`
   - Backend server handles the FTP upload and thumbnail generation
   - Response is sent back to frontend

2. **Production Mode**:
   - If `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is set, it uses that URL for FTP upload
   - If not set, it falls back to PHP API upload
   - If PHP API fails, it tries Cloudinary as a fallback
   - If all methods fail, it generates a QR code with an error message

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix is working:

1. Ensure the backend server is running:
   ```bash
   cd backend && PORT=3002 node server.js
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Go through the complete flow in the application:
   - Upload a photo or use the camera
   - Confirm the photo
   - Wait for AI processing to complete
   - On the final result page, verify that:
     * Images are uploaded successfully
     * Thumbnails are generated and displayed
     * QR codes are generated and displayed

4. Check the browser console for any errors
5. Check the backend server console for any errors

## Files Modified

1. [vite.config.ts](file:///Users/paulchang/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PDF/Ebees/Project/Wynn%20x%20MIF/ai-changecloth/vite.config.ts) - Updated proxy configuration
2. [services/ftpUploadService.ts](file:///Users/paulchang/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PDF/Ebees/Project/Wynn%20x%20MIF/ai-changecloth/services/ftpUploadService.ts) - Updated backend URL logic
3. [.env.local](file:///Users/paulchang/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PDF/Ebees/Project/Wynn%20x%20MIF/ai-changecloth/.env.local) - Added backend URL environment variable

## Verification

After implementing these changes, the upload process should work correctly in both development and production environments. The application should:

✅ Successfully upload images to the FTP server
✅ Generate thumbnails under 200KB
✅ Display thumbnails instead of full images in the final result page
✅ Generate and display QR codes for sharing
✅ Handle errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
