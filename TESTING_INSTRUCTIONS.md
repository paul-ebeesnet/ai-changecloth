# Testing Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions to test all the fixes and improvements made to the AI Changecloth application.

## Overview of Fixes

1. **QRCode Loading Issue Fixed** - Robust loading mechanism with multiple CDN fallbacks
2. **Thumbnail Generation** - Proper thumbnail generation under 200KB
3. **Thumbnail Display** - Final result page now shows thumbnails instead of full images
4. **PHP API Improvements** - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test QRCode Loading Fix

Open `test-qr-code-fix.html` in your browser:

1. Click the "Test QRCode Generation" button
2. Verify that the QRCode is generated successfully
3. Check the logs for any errors

Expected result: QRCode should be generated without errors, even if the primary CDN fails.

### 2. Test Complete Flow

Open `test-complete-flow.html` in your browser:

1. Click "Test QRCode Generation" and verify success
2. Click "Test PHP API Upload" and verify the image is uploaded successfully
3. Click "Test Complete Flow" and verify all steps complete successfully

Expected result: All tests should pass with thumbnails generated under 200KB and accessible via the returned URLs.

### 3. Test Actual Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the application in your browser (typically http://localhost:3000)

3. Go through the complete flow:
   - Upload a photo or use the camera
   - Confirm the photo
   - Wait for AI processing to complete
   - On the final result page, verify:
     * Thumbnails are displayed instead of full images
     * QRCode is generated and displayed
     * Upload to PHP API is successful

4. Check the uploaded files:
   - Visit https://ebeesnet.com/project/wynn-mif/img/
   - Verify that both the full image and thumbnail are present
   - Verify that the thumbnail is under 200KB

### 4. Test Error Handling

1. Temporarily disconnect from the internet
2. Try to upload an image
3. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
4. Reconnect to the internet and try again

Expected result: Application should gracefully handle errors and provide helpful messages to the user.

## Files to Verify

### Modified Files
- `services/ftpUploadService.ts` - Enhanced QRCode loading with fallbacks
- `App.tsx` - Improved thumbnail display in final result page
- `backend/upload.php` - Enhanced thumbnail generation (new file)

### New Test Files
- `test-qr-code-fix.html` - Tests QRCode loading fix
- `test-complete-flow.html` - Tests complete flow from QRCode to upload
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of all fixes
- `TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This file

## Expected Outcomes

1. ✅ QRCode library loads successfully from multiple CDN sources
2. ✅ Thumbnails are generated under 200KB
3. ✅ Final result page displays thumbnails instead of full images
4. ✅ Images and thumbnails are successfully uploaded to the server
5. ✅ QRCode is generated and displayed correctly
6. ✅ Error handling works properly with helpful messages

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that all CDN sources are accessible
3. Ensure the PHP API endpoint is working correctly
4. Check server logs for any errors in `backend/upload.php`

## Additional Notes

- The application now uses a more robust approach to loading external libraries
- Thumbnail generation has been optimized to ensure files are under 200KB
- The frontend properly displays thumbnails when available with a fallback to full images
- Comprehensive error handling has been implemented throughout the upload process
